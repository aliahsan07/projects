Andrew Gass Code inspeaction:

Adventurer:
deck count for the for treasure would go short one too many places at z-1>0
does not account for treasure that you had in draw
adventurer is not discarded.
should subtrack the value of the position.

feast:
destroys the hand and saves it as a temp hand.
updates coins rather than allowing a choice for a card.
card loops as a result of lack of return -1
defaults to discard rather than an improper use case.
can go out of bounds when reinstantiating the player's hand.
does not discard feast at the end.

mine discards to discard and not trash.
instantiation of the mine function is not in order as thought.
