Severity: Minor
Priority: Medium, smithy cannot be played correctly with this bug. 
Date: 6/9/2015

File bug is found in: dominion.c
Description: This bug is found in the refactored smithy function. While the function gives +3 cards correctly, it also unnecessarily gives out 2 actions. 
If you were to delete line 695, your function implementation would be correct.
