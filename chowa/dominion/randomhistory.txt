Random testing history log

Other Files: 
1. Added to dominion.c check to ensure that adventurer does not loop endlessly when there is one or less treasure cards
2. Added to dominion.c additional function to calculate total number of cards combined (deck, discard and hand) for a player

Adventurer testing
1. Compares before and after count of total cards and number of cards in hand when running the card effect function for adventurer
2. Card effect for adventurer changed to return number of treasures added to hand (between 1 to 2) for smaller sets, the chance of having no treasure cards left
	much more likely. With more often large random seeds sets for this test, this would probably now show up often.
