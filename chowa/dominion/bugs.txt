Bugs:


In the interest of full disclosure, I did add in files after midnight on Monday. The reason being I destroyed all my previous work because I somehow made even SVN not idiot-proof. I ran SVN revert because I thought it would get rid of the commit errors and ended up reverting back to all the files I had currently in the repo which included the empty dummy files I had. So dock me the late points, but I'm going to turn in my finished assignment

Now for bugs:

scoring system function forScore was using the discardDeck count value instead of the deckCount value for the number of cards left in the deck. That would have resulted in issues if there were more cards in the discard deck then the rest of the deck.
