Bug Report 1 for rodrijos:
Tested by Khue Tran

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Bug Found:
  The refractored Council Room card function would fail everytime it's played because it returns a -1 instead of a 0 which is what my test code is expecting. This does not affect game play much because all the internal functions are still correct, it's just returning a value different than what the Assersion check expects.

To Fix Bug:
  To fix this, you just need to change line 717 from
      return -1;    to    return 0;
  and it should return the correct value again. I would consider this to be a minor bug and not worry too much about the error that I received from earlier.
