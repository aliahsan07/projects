The first step I took for writing the random adventurer test was to figure out what should be changed by playing the card. I realized that the implementation of the card would not handle a situation where there were fewer than 2 treasure cards in the discard and draw pile, so I used an if/else to catch and not call the cardeffect if there weren't 2 treasure, instead just recording an error. The adventurer card causes changes in the number of cards in the hand, the sum of the deck and discards, and specifically in the number of treasure cards in the hand, so I checked those statistics. It did find errors in about 10 percent of cases; mostly insufficient treasure errors. I found that altering the card's implementation did not break the test as I would have expected.
For the smithy, the only things to check were that cards were removed from the total of deck and discard, and that cards were added to the hand. I'm currently running into a segfault with the .out for this, and I'm not sure why. It's essentially the same code as randomtestadventurer.
