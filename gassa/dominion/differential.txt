I was unable to run the differential, as the code never seemed to complete 
for an output. I'm not sure if this is due to bugs in the dominion code,
or an infinite loop in my own code, but since I haven't found how to 
have cygwin output print commands on my console, I'm having trouble
errorchecking.
