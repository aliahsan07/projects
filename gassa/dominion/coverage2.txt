In order of lines executed, descending, my tests went
initializeGame (24), council_room (19), village (15), 
smithy (12), endTurn (10), gardens (9), shuffle (8),
and supplyCount (5). The biggest influence where the loops
required for the init and council tests; council affects all
players, and I tested init against several startup cases.
If planning to use a profiler like gcov, it would be best
to not nest calls as much as I did.
