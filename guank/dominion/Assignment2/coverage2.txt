Coverage:

Based on the results of the gcov, my tests executed about 20% of the code overall.
Unit Test 1: newGame - 100% 
Unit Test 2: updateCoins ~40%
Unit Test 3: buyCard - 100%
Unit Test 4: isGameOver - 100%

Card Test: Gardens - 100%
Card Test: Village - 100%
Card Test: Smithy - 100%
Card Test: Salvager - 67%



Implications: 

Unit Tests - Overall, Unit Tests 1, 3, and 4 had excellent coverage where no every line was executed
with zero bugs. On the other hand, Unit Test 2 lacked coverage in comparison. However,
this coverage can be fixed if I created more test cases based on the further outcomes that 
the players may occur when updating the coins. 

Card Test - For the Card Tests, most of them had excellent coverage with little to no bugs. The exception
would be Salvager. Salvager's test found a bug where the discard pile isn't updated properly after the card was
activated. I believe that my unit test contains the bug, rather than a bug within Dominion, since the coverage 
on the function's discarding properties was miniscule.
