Refactored:
Remodel
Council_Room
Village
Mine
Smithy

The refactored functions are the following:
int eff_Smithy(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
int eff_Village(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
int eff_Council_Room(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos)
int eff_Mine(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos, int choice1, int choice2)
int eff_Remodel(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int choice1, int choice2, int handPos)

Bugs:
1) In eff_Smithy, an = was added to the loop conditions.
2) In eff_Mine, choice1 and choice2 were swapped within the function call.
