Adventurer:

The coverage for the adventurer section is fully covered, while the overall coverage of the
entire Dominion.c is 24.35%. Throughout the random tests, the player's treasures are constantly
checked to see if the treasure from Adventurer was properly added. Everything worked properly
when the number of tests were low. However, when that number incresed, initialization errors started 
occurring which caused an error where the treasure cards are not properly getting distrubuted after card activation. 
The random values that were utilized were player count, hand count, discard count, current player, and seed.


RandomCard (Village):

The coverage for the village section is fully covered, while the overall coverage of the
entire Dominion.c is 24.52%. The random values were similar to the prior test which
player count, hand count, discard count, current player, and seed were utilized.
After the randomization, the code checks if the actions and cards were properly distributed.
The overall coverage increased slightly when I adjusted the conditions of the cardeffect function
when it called for village.
