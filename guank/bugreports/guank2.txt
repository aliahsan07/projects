Bug Report for zakrevsm.

When comparing the game results from the testdominion random tester, one of the noticeable differences
is that Gardens was able to activate when restrictions should have prevented the player from activating it. 
Upon investigating the source code, it appears that Gardens is returning 0 rather than -1 upon activation. This
difference allowed it to bypass restrictions which allowed the card to be activated and also decremented action count
like normal action cards.
