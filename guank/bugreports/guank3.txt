Bug Report for zakrevsm.

When Smithy is activated, the card fails to add cards to players hands. After activation,
the user's hand count remains the same. After inspecting the source code, it is found that
the function that runs Smithy's process only draws one card and discards the used Smithy card
afterwards. For this case, calling the drawCard function two more times before calling the discard function
will resolve the problem. 

drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
