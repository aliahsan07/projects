Bug Report for whitewi.

When I ran my Salvager unit test, I noticed that the card effect is not behaving properly where players are not given 
extra buys after activation. After investigating the source code, it appears that nothing in the card effect function is incrementing
the buy count of the players.

The bug can be resolved via incrementing the buy count within the game state:
state->numBuys++;
