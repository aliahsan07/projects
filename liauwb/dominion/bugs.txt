As mentioned by someone before, most of the functions does not handle null value.
I feel that this should never be a problem because nothing should be given a null value

All of the functions tested does not have bugs in it

One person reported on a bug that does not handle negative number in the function update coins but I feel that
coins will never be negative as it will stop the buy function if the coins is going to be negative
