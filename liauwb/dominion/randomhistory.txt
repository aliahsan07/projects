What I did with the random testing is that I merely randomed the number of decks, hands and discard pile.
The coverage shows about 20% and I think this is about as much as I can get considering I only tested one
functions at a time

There is a lot of bugs in the adventurer. It reduces hand count more than it should and discard pile is more than it should be.
