Before my debugging, I had my code tested using my previous tests and see if it fails. There is not much to be said other than the fact that most test are passed and it does not really help me in finding new bugs. So I had to modify it a bit as well as check others' bug report and see if I have something similar to them.
After looking at others' bug report (since no one has wrote me a bug report yet as of the time of writing this txt), I find bugs that I have not realize it's there. Most are significant enough that it doesn't break the game and simply does mathematical error or whatnot.
One of the bugs that I figure out with a debugger (GDB) is the bug where baron can cause negative number of cards. 
According to Agan's rules, first, we must understand the system. I believe I do have an adequate degree of knowledge regarding the cards and mechanic of the game, therefore satisfying rule 1. I also have to satisfy rule 2 in order to realize that there is a bug in the code. Then as soon as I check the code. I realize playing baron causes it to decrement estate twice using the debugger.
