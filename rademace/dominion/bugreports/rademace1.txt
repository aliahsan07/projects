This is a bug report for dominion.c, belonging to galec.

If you have two treasure cards in your deck before you play the Adventurer
card, then those two treasure cards should be removed from your deck by
playing the adventurer card.  But galec's dominion.c does not behave like
this. It fails the assertion that the deck after the Adventurer card is played
contains two less treasure cards than before it was played. I ran the tests
passing several different seeds to randomtestadventurer.c,
and each time, the final number of treasure cards in the deck was 4 less
than initially. I found the error in dominion.c to be on line 661. It was
drawing a treasure card from the deck 4 times instead of 2. I fixed this, and
reran the tests, and they all passed.
