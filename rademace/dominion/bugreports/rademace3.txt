This is a bug report for luans' implementation of dominion.c.

luans' dominion.c had the same bug that huangma's dominion.c had:
the scores for the players were not being counted up properly due to
a fault in the scoreFor() function. When I ran testdominion.c on luans' dominion.c, 
however, it resulted in a segmentation fault.
