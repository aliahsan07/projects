I ran testdominion.c on my implementation of dominion.c to produce 
gameResultsRef.out.

I ran testdominion.c on the implementation of dominion.c belonging to
"kaiserh" to produce gameResults.out.

I then used the UNIX diff command to compare gameResults.out with 
gameResultsRef.out, and stored the result in testdominion.out.

This differential testing was very useful, because it caught the
point where the two implementations of dominion.c diverged right
away. In kaiserh's implementation, the two "dominon player bots"
start the game with a different number of victory points. 
kaiserh's dominon.c clearly has a bug, because all players
should always start out with 3 victory points.
