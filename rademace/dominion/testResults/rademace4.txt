This is a bug report for the implementation of dominion.c belonging to odled.


When I ran testdominion.c on odled's implementation of dominion.c, a segmentation fault
resulted. By examining the output of testdominion.c run with many different
seeds, I found that odled's implementation of dominion.c always seg faults when trying
to play the Great Hall card. I looked and found that odled had refactored
dominion.c so that it called a function, Great_hall, to play the Great Hall card.
The function took three parameters, but it was being called without any parameters.
