Bug #1: discardCard() does not increment state->discardCount[currentPlayer].


Bug #2: When the Great Hall card is used, the current player's hand is not increased by 4.
	-SOLVED (problem with test)


Bug #3: When the Cutpurse card is used, a copper is not removed from other players' hands.
	-SOLVED (problem with test)


Bug #4: Score changes randomly for both players. 
	Starts out at around two or three, 
	then increases to around 25-35 throughout the game. Sometimes it 
	randomly goes down.

	Possible Causes: Adjacent arrays in gamestate struct overstepping bounds.

	Fixes: Does compiler warn of overstepping array bounds? No.
	Try adding some "padding" in gamestate struct in dominion.h - doesn't work.
	
	-SOLVED BY FIXING BUG #5


Bug #5 (in dominion.c, line 444): loop counts up to state->discardCount[player],
	when it should count up to state->deckCount[player]. - FIXED
	

Bug #6: After a kingdom card is played, it disappears from the game.

Bug #7: testdominion.c hangs up (gets stuck in infinite loop?)
	when given a random number seed of 325501.
	
Bug #8:	(dominion.c, line 843)
	"if ( (getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 2) > getCost(choice2) )"
	should be "if ( (getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 2) < getCost(choice2) )"
	-RESOLVED
