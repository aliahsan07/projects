When looking at the output of testdominion.c, I examined players' cards and it 
appeared to me that that a player would sometimes buy a card, 
and then that card would disappear from the game after he had played it.


To test this theory, I re-implemented testdominion.c so that it never included the 
Salvager card (which trashes a card). I performed log analysis on the output of testdominion.c
for each game. I compared the quantity of 
each card bought with the number of that card found in all the players' 
hands, decks, and discard piles. I disregarded the Feast, Embargo, and Treasure Map
in this count, because these cards get trashed when you use them. I found that every time
a card is played, it disappears from the game.


I deduced that the discardCard() function was the likely, culprit, since it is called 
every time a card is played. I took a look at discardCard() in dominion.c and found that
nowhere in this function is the card to be discarded added to the player's discard pile,
hand, or deck. The card is added to the played card pile, but in the endTurn() function
it is never retreived. To fix this bug, I simply added the code in discardCard() to 
add the card to the player's discard pile and increment their discard count. After this,
I still had some tests failing, but only 284 out of 1000 random tests failed, compared
with 687 out of 1000 before I made the fix.

One of Agan's rules that was essential for me finding this bug was Rule #1: Understand
the system. It would have been extremely difficult for me to have found this bug 10 
weeks ago. It was only through the
understanding of dominion.c that I gained over all these weeks of looking over it and
writing tests for it that I was able to track down that bug as quickly as I had.
