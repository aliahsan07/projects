When looking at the output of testdominion.c, I examined players' cards and it 
appeared to me that that a player would sometimes buy a card, 
and then that card would disappear from the game after he had played it.


To test this theory, I re-implemented testdominion.c so that it never included the 
Salvager card (which trashes a card). I performed log analysis on the output of testdominion.c
for each game. I compared the quantity of 
each card bought with the number of that card found in all the players' 
hands, decks, and discard piles. I disregarded the Feast, Embargo, and Treasure Map
in this count, because these cards get trashed when you use them. I found that every time
a card is played, it disappears from the game.
