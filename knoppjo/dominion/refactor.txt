In dominion.c, moved code from switch statements in cardEffect to seperate functions for the following cards:
	garden
	smithy
	village
	great_hall
	outpost

The new function names are the name of the card appended with Effect i.e. gardenEffect. Each new function header was also added to dominion_helpers.h
