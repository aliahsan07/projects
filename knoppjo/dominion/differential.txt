The primary difference I see in the diff file is that the other player I'm running my test code on doesn't
draw in the first hand. I'm not sure why that is, but it makes things difficult to evaluate beyond that.
The initialize game function must be the location of the bug, as mine is unchanged and draws
5 cards for the first player on the first turn.
