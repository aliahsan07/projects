When testing the village card I was unable to break the code. I simply randomized the players
and the piles of cards and whose turn it was and had them play the village. Then I checked whether
the player had the correct number of cards in his hand and the correct number of actions. I got around 
30% coverage which is what I expected when only testing the one card. 

When testing the adventurer I did the same in terms of randomization with the addition of adding specific cards to each deck. 
I then tested whether the appropriate treasure cards were added to the hand from the deck. I was able to get 5 failures out of 1000
and am not sure what caused them. This is somewhat troubling. I also got 30% coverage when testing this funciton.
