Adventurer:

Modified randomtestadventurer.c, it was segfaulting upon running. They can only be ran 12 times before 
segfaulting so I changed the max to 11.  Ensured there were at least 2 playersfor each test. Ensured
there were treasures in each deck.

Gardens:

randomtestcard.c had various issues with it. Instead of changing it, I moved
it to randomtestcard_1.c and copied randomtestadventurer.c to
randomtestcard.c. It made more sense to reuse the already working code and
just change the card effect to gardens.
