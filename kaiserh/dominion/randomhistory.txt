Random Testers 5/11/15
Created Adventurer test
Command: make runAdventurer
	-Discovered Adventurer card was not discarded within switch statement in cardEffect
		Fixed issue by adding discard line.
	-Discovered the danger of creating your own bugs within your test by not properly 
		checking which player was supposed to be evaluated during a test.
	-Reached coverage of 25.48% on initial implementation.
	-Added random card draw to each tested player and discovered that if discard and 
		deck are empty the draw fails a check should be in place for this as a player
		can possibly play all cards each turn before the discard would fill with cards.
	-Added two money cards to discard when deck count is low after draws and all
		assertions passed.
	-Added coins total assertion test to end of test.
	-Reached coverage of 32.76% with ample use of lines within adventurer effect
Created Steward test
Command: make runRandomCard
	-Failed on coin branch in switch within cardEffect, altered coin add to use bonus_coin
		feature to prevent wiping of coin addition.
	-Reached coverage of 29.46% on initial implementation with full line coverage in 
		switch statement.
	-Upped TEST_COUNT to 5000 and added multiple variable plays per turn.
	-Reverted multiple plays per test as the results became unpredictable past a single card.
		Requires investigation into called functions to determine a more reliable system for
		acknowlegding failures from API.
