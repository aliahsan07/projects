Bug Report: Matthew Zakrevsky Dominion Implementation

BUG: Smithy drawing 1 card instead of 3.

When running my unit test suite I encountered a massive difference in the results of playCard. I used Smithy as it was basic on my implementation and the one in question. Upon review the deckCount was two larger with the other dominion.c. I reviewed smithy and discovered the drawCard function was called only once instead of three times.

int smithyRef(struct gameState *state, int handPos, int currentPlayer)
{
	
---->	drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	
	discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	
	return 0 ;
	
}
