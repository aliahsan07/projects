Bug Report: Matthew Zakrevsky Dominion Implementation

BUG: Coins earned from played cards are removed before a player can buy.

When reviewing the differences on my random tester between my implementation and this one I found the coin totals were off throughout the game. I determined this was a result of playCard calling updateCoins at the end of the function whereas cardEffect manually edited the state to add coins. UpdateCoins overwrote this additions and lost the bonus coins earned by cards before purchases could be made.

int playCard(int handPos, int choice1, int choice2, int choice3, struct gameState *state) 
{	
  int card;
  HERE---->int coin_bonus = 0; //tracks coins gain from actions

  //check if it is the right phase
  if (state->phase != 0)
    {
      return -1;
    }
	
  //check if player has enough actions
  if ( state->numActions < 1 )
    {
      return -1;
    }
	
  //get card played
  card = handCard(handPos, state);
	
  //check if selected card is an action
  if ( card < adventurer || card > treasure_map )
    {
      return -1;
    }
	
  //play card
  if ( cardEffect(card, choice1, choice2, choice3, state, handPos, &coin_bonus) < 0 )
    {
      return -1;
    }
	
  //reduce number of actions
  state->numActions--;

  //update coins (Treasure cards may be added with card draws)
  HERE---->updateCoins(state->whoseTurn, state, coin_bonus);
