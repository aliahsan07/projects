I have chosen to picked up implements of function, such as adventure, council_room, mine, feast, and embargo. Also, I have add those define of functions at the bottom of dominion.h.

The function of adventure card is func_adventure. I removed the variables cardDraw, drawtreasure, and z from cardEffect and added them to adventureEffect.

The function that implements the tribute card is named tributeEffect. I removed the variables nextPlayer and tributeRevealedCards from cardEffect and added them to tributeEffect.

The function that implements the feast card is named feastEffect. I removed the variable x from cardEffect and added it to feastEffect. I also removed the variable temphand from cardEffect and added it to adventureEffect and feastEffect.

The function that implements the treasure map card is named treasureMapEffect. I removed the variable index from cardEffect and added it to treasureMapEffect.

The function implementing the baron card is named baronEffect.
