Did an informal code review that included the following three people: Corinne Brucks, Curtis Minks, and myself Will Olsen.

The review process was itself very informal. We sat down around a central screen and would look at each individuals code.
The owner leading the review while the other two participants analysed and asked questions.
In particular we did a static analysis of the card effect functions created in assignment one.

Review Curtis Minks dominion.c code:
	steward
	line 690:	Conditional statement of else if was same as the if statement above.
				This would cause this branch to never be run.
	treasure_map
	line 717:	Conditional statement of if statement is always true, because index is always greater than or equal to negative one.
				This causes the branch to always be run, even when it should not.

Review Corinne Brucks dominion.c code:
	councilroom
	line 10:	Player draws five cards instead of four.
	line 20:	Player gains an action when no action should be gained.
	line 28:	Other players draw two cards instead of drawing one card. 
	smithy
	line 40:	Player draws nine cards instead of drawing three cards.
	village
	line 54:	Player only gains one action instead of two actions

Review Will Olsen dominion.c code:
	Feast
	line 1168:	Counting variable is set to negative one.
				Prevents following while loop from running.
	Gardens
	line 1219:	One, indicating success, returned instead of a negative one, indicating failure.
	Mine
	line 1227:	Incorrectly sets which player's turn it is.
				Causes all statements related to the player to likely fail.
	Remodel
	line 1272:	Condition of if statement prevents cards that cost two more than discarded.
				Could only effectively remodel card for a card that costed one more.
