the score is not consistent when players do nothing. It can change from turn to turn.

testdominion does not pass an action phase unless it has too.
testdominion does not pass an buy phase unless it has too.
testdominion does only one action and one buy

testdominion set up to run one test at a time.

When you run testdominion you can see the deterministic output for a game of dominion.
By comparing the output of one implementation vs another you can see if the results
from both implementations differ,which are possibly errors/bugs, occur. For the case
of seed 33 something is going wrong when playing card 11 (the mine). By knowing this
is an issue I could run testdominion in gdb and see exactly when the implementations
differ and why.
