I compared my dominion.c with the dominion.c in "rodrijos" directory

Our dominion games did not differ very much probably because we didn't bother to fix the game.
The coverage is about a 2% difference between our codes.

The money gained is too much for the all of the cards (Cutpurse gives 14 money) because the cards were not fixed
