Inspecting Spike Madden's Code
Inspected by: Garrett Amidon

Group with: Mikkel Hansen, Michael Oatman, Spike Madden


Process:

To start, I got Spike's dominion.c file from his directory with his permission. I then proceeded to
add his file to my directory. I first moved my dominion.c file out of my directory so it wouldn't overwrite
and I would not have to change anything in my makefile. Next, I ran all of my Unit and Card tests followed by
the Random Card test functions then the full code test. The results are documented below:

Bug Testing

Unittest1:
PASSED

Unittest2:
PASSED

Unittest3:
PASSED

Unittest4:
PASSED

Cardtest1:
PASSED

Cardtest2:
PASSED

Cardtest3:
PASSED

Cardtest4:
FAILED: Number of actions is wrong. When adding 2 actions when using village, it actually takes one away instead. 
	//+2 Actions
  state->numActions = state->numActions - 1;

RandomTestAdventurer:

PASSED

RandomTestCard:

PASSED

TestDominion:

When running my testdominion on Spike's dominion, I ran it 100 times and of the 100, it broke 23 times because it lost count of the player. This leads
me to believe that there is something wrong with the way the code keeps track of whose turn it is. Other than that, there seems to be no other errors.
