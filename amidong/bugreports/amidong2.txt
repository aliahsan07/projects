Bug Type: Returned 1 instead of 0 in Council Room

Description:
	While debugging the code, I wrote a new function that checks the cardEffect function and checks that
	all returned values are either -1 or 0. I also made a running counter inside of the loop so when there
	was a returned valued that wasn't -1 or 0, I could go to that case statement. From there it returned 1 
	when the counter was at 8, so I checked the Enum and it said case 8 was Council Room. I then checked
	council_room_effect and on line 708, it said return 1.
