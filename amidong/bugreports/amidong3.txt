Bug Type: Infinite Loop in Feast

Whose dominion: Oatmanm

Description:
		In the cardEffect of feast, after the initial for loop, it goes into this while loop.
		But if the first if statement or the else if statement, the function will be stuck
		in a forever loop. Considering the only time x is being changed is in the last else
		statement, if the user has not enough money, it will just keep running the print statement
		saying "That card is too expensive." To fix this, add something in the if and else if statement
		that changes the value of x. 
		
	while( x == 1) {//Buy one card
	if (supplyCount(choice1, state) <= 0){
	  if (DEBUG)
	    printf("None of that card left, sorry!\n");

	  if (DEBUG){
	    printf("Cards Left: %d\n", supplyCount(choice1, state));
	  }
	}
	else if (state->coins < getCost(choice1)){
	  printf("That card is too expensive!\n");

	  if (DEBUG){
	    printf("Coins: %d < %d\n", state->coins, getCost(choice1));
	  }
	}
	else{

	  if (DEBUG){
	    printf("Deck Count: %d\n", state->handCount[currentPlayer] + state->deckCount[currentPlayer] + state->discardCount[currentPlayer]);
	  }

	  gainCard(choice1, state, 0, currentPlayer);//Gain the card
	  x = 0;//No more buying cards

	  if (DEBUG){
	    printf("Deck Count: %d\n", state->handCount[currentPlayer] + state->deckCount[currentPlayer] + state->discardCount[currentPlayer]);
	  }

	}
      }
