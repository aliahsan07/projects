Bugs found:
    - The Baron handler in cardEffect changes state->coins directly. It's
        obviously supposed to change *bonus instead, since playCards then
        uses the value of *bonus to recalculate state->coins.
    - The Adventurer function play_adventurer in card.c segfaults under certain
        conditions. This is a bug I intentionally introduced in Assignment 1.
        There are no curly braces around the else clause in the second
        conditional, although the indentation suggests there should be. This
        causes the second and third line to run every iteration, making z grow
        beyond the maximum index of temphand. If the deck and discard don't
        contain at least two treasure cards, this results in a buffer overrun
        and the program usually segfaults.
