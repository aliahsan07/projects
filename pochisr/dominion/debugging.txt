For some reason, it took me until now to realize that this Dominion
implementation trashes all played cards instead of discarding them. This file
describes the process of finding and fixing this bug.

I discovered this bug in the process of trying to diagnose a separate bug in a
classmate's Dominion implementation. I was looking thought the log of a test
case in which the discard pile contained a card with the value -1 (which is
invalid). I muddled through the code in a debugger, setting breakpoints and
looking at the contents of the discard pile, and I discovered that the bug was
probably in the function discardCard. I was trying to find the bug by
inspection when I realized I couldn't find the code that moved played cards
into the discard pile.

I switched back to my code, assuming that either I'd already fixed the bug in
my code or my classmate had introduced it intentionally. After setting
watchpoints on the discard pile and count, I discovered that the bug was
present in my code as well. Again, I tried to find the bug by inspection, and
then I tried going through entire turns watching the current player's discard
pile, and it became apparent that it was never modified except at the beginning
and end of a turn. I looked through the log again to find more things to check
in the debugger, and I noticed that no played card was *ever* moved into the
discard pile, not even (say) via another temporary array I'd forgotten to pay
attention to.
