    I factored out card handling code into play_adventurer, play_council_room,
    play_feast, play_mine, and play_remodel. Some scratch variables had a
    declaration/initialization shared between all of the card handling code. I
    copied those declarations to the newly created functions, because it
    doesn't make sense to pass a function un- or trivially-initialized scratch
    variables.
