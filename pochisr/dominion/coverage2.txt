My tests covered 44% of the 559 lines in dominion.c and card.c, which is better
than nothing but not great. As expected, the majority of the lines not covered
handle cards I didn't test. I also didn't manage to cover the code that counts
a player's score in their discard pile and their deck, and I missed many of the
lines involving end of game. This warrants better tests, since being able to
tell when the game is over and who won is just as important as being able to
play the game in the first place.
