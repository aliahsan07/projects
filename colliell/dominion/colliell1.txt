Reason: Incorrect gameplay

Description:
The baron card, when played, only gives 3 coins to the current player if an estate card is in their hand. Reproduce by running baron_test.c and find that the coins increase by 3. Expected result is an increase in coins by 4. Probable cause found on line 1332: 

	state->coins += 3;//Add 4 coins to the amount of coins
