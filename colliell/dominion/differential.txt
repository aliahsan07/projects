
	After running my testdominion.c tester on both my own dominion and the one from hansemik's repo, I found quite a few significant errors. In regards to the card functionality, some errors were in both implementations and some were unique to either his or mine. This is valuable because seeing the difference between how the game was played shows me what errors are specific to my implementation and which are specific to his (i.e., what individual bugs we introduced in assignment 1). It also shows me the similarities between our implementations, meaning errors that existed in dominion.c before we even started to mess with it. For example, in both implementations there is occasionally a negative deck count (which shouldn't ever happen), Tribute seems to put the game in an endless action-phase loop, and the Feast action had to be commented out to avoid program stall (see testdominion.c).

	The value of this information is that I now have a pretty good idea of which cards had bugs in them already, as well as where my implementation has a bug (recalling assignment 1). As a result of this comparison, I would check my Remodel functionality and look for bugs or even compare my code with his to find differences.
	
	Using the same seeds and playing one game, then diffing the results, the implementations really only differed with regards to discarding cards correctly. My dominion.c doesn't seem to be moving players' cards from the deck to the discard pile correctly; after buying a card, it is put in a player's hand rather than their deck. Other than that, the implementations had the same output.
