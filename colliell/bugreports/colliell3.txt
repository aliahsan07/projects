Description:
The minion card, when played, discards the hands of and draws 3 new cards for players with at least 4 cards in their hands when this option is given. Found via visual inspection of source code after discovering Bug 2 in minion function. Expected result is that all players (other than the current player) with at least 5 cards in their hands discard their hand and draw 4 new cards. Probable cause found on line 53:

	if (state->handCount[i] > 3)
