Implications:
	unittest1 - Exceptional coverage. All lines executed. No bugs.
	unittest2 - Only two lines were not executed because they have to do with the 
		shuffle function returning an incorrect value and with the deckCount 
		being initialized incorrectly.
	unittest3 - Exceptional coverage. All lines executed. No bugs.
	unittest4 - Exceptional coverage. All lines executed. No bugs.
	cardtest1 - Exceptional coverage. All lines executed. No bugs.
	cardtest2 - Exceptional coverage. All lines executed. No bugs.
	cardtest3 - Exceptional coverage. All lines executed. No bugs.
	cardtest4 - Exceptional coverage. All lines executed. No bugs.
