Bug Title: sea_hag changes values of deckCount and deck
Bug Report for knoppjo
By: Mikkel Hansen
File: dominion.c

I ran my testdominion on your code and in the gameResults.out file I saw
that the deckCount of some players is sometimes a negative number. I then 
narrowed the bug down to something to do with the sea_hag card because this 
bug always happens after sea_hag is played. The reason for the bug is that
the expression "--" instead of "-1". The is causing the deckCount to decrement.

Line 1209:

	case sea_hag:
		for (i = 0; i < state->numPlayers; i++){
			if (i != currentPlayer){
				state->discard[i][state->discardCount[i]] = state->deck[i][state->deckCount[i]--];			    state->deckCount[i]--;
				state->discardCount[i]++;
				state->deck[i][state->deckCount[i]--] = curse;//Top card now a curse
			}
		}
		return 0;

While the player is supposed to discard the top card of the deck, they are
instead putting the deck card that is one index too high into the discard
pile and then decrementing the deckCount. In order to fix this "--" needs to 
be replaced with "-1" and some more logic needs to be added to corrently
decrement or increment the deckCount. Instead of a post decrement, a pre
decrement could also be used.

Reproduction Steps:
In my dominion directory, run "make runBug3"

Severity: Medium since this bug could cause problems with the game state since 
the deckCount can be negative but I have not encountered a crash associated
with this bug so far.

Priority: Low since the card does not do what it is supposed to do but
it requires some logic to fix.
