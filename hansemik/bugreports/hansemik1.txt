Bug Title: cardRemodel incorrect return values
Bug Report for olsenw

I ran my cardtest2 on your code and I found that the remodel card
returns -1 and doesn't perform the remodel when given correct 
input. The reason for this bug is in the line that checks if the
card being traded costs at most 2 coins more has a ">" rather 
than a "<".

Line 1272:

	if ((getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 2) > getCost(choice2))
	{
		return -1;
	}

I gave the input of choice1 as copper and input of choice2 as curse,
which both have a cost of 0. Even though this is a weird remodel
scenario, it is still a valid remodel. Since there is a ">" rather than
a "<" the code calculates that (getCost(copper) + 2) > getCost(curse) and returns -1.
 The dominion.h file defines choice1 as the card to get
rid of and choice2 as the card to receive. To fix the bug, change the 
">" to a "<" and it will pass over this if statement.


Reproduction Steps:
In my dominion directory, run "make runBug1"

Severity: Medium since it does not play the card at all in this case
and could potentially remodel a card costing too much, however it does
not currupt the state of the game.

Priority: High since the card doesn't do what it is supposed to most of
the time but it is a very simple fix.
