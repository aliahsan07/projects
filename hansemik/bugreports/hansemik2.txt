Bug Title: cardMine incorrect return values
Bug Report for gassa
By: Mikkel Hansen
File: dominion.c

I ran my cardtest4 and I found that the mine card returns a -1 when
given correct input and doesn't perform the switch of coin cards. The
reason for this bug is that your parameters for choice1 and choice2 are
mixed up.

Line 760:

int cardMine(int choice2, int choice1, struct gameState *state, int handPos)
{

Line 838:

    case mine:
		return cardMine(choice1,choice2,state,handPos);

The argument order is choice1 and then choice2 while the paramter order
is switched. This is causing the code to return on this line:

Line 768:

    if (state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1] < copper || state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1] > gold)
		{
	  		return -1;
		}

Reproduction Steps:
In my dominion directory, run "make runBug2"

Since choice2 is the supply number of the card to recieve according to 
the dominion.h file, this supply number gets translated to a hand position
in the if statement, and the enum of the card in the hand at that position 
could be anything. To fix the bug, change the ordering of the parameters on
line 760.

Severity: Medium because it the bug happens often but does not cause the 
game to crash.

Priority: Medium since switching the choices will almost always cause the
card to function incorrectly but it is an easy fix.
