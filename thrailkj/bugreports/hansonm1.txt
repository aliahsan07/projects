Bug description: When second option is chosen, ref_minion() only checks if other players have > 3 cards in hand, as opposed to 5 (line 52). In addition, ref_minion only gives back 3 cards to those who discarded their hands, as opposed to 4 (line 61).  

Relevant code:

52| if (state->handCount[i] > 3)

60| //draw 3
61| for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)
