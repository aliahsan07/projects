Bug description: the villageCard() function gives the player 3 extra actions, instead of 2.
line 686 of dominion.c

Relevant code:

683| int villageCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos) {
684|
685|	drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
686|	state->numActions = state->numActions + 3;
687|	discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
688|
689|	return 0;
690| }
