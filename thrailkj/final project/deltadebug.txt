To start, the first thing I did was download the delta debugging files from Zeller's website.
I decided to choose the case in which my random testers for the two dominion cards would segfault. 
I chose this because it is something that I am aware of failing and I feel like it can be 
found out what is causing this problem through delta debugging. My passing test case was when 
the random tester gets through all of its tests and does not run into a seg fault of any kind. 
I then setup  and edited the DD.py, and used some functions from Zeller's modules before running. 
Even though I felt prepared through the tutorial from the website, when I went to 
go run it, I would have errors of some kind, along with the script crashing, or 
failing to run correctly or something. It was not working as I had imagined it to. 
So when all was said and done, I could not find the cause of my seg fault. 
For a while I thought it was tied to the number of time I ran the test, but 
I would find that it could seg fault on either a high or low number.
