BUG REPORT 1

### Program: "Dominion.c" by ONID: alzamilb

### Issue: "shuffle" function does not shuffle first (0th) player's cards


### Details:

When beginning a game of dominion with:
	Kingdom Cards: {smithy, gardens, adventurer, minion, feast, 
		       village, sea_hag, treasure_map, baron, great_hall}
	
	Number of Players: 2

	random seed: 2

The calling "shuffle" from dominion.c on the gameState struct only shuffles
the second player's cards. The first player's deck remains the same. Calling 
shuffle with these parameters will consistently result in this issue.
