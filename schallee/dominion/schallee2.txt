BUG REPORT 2

### Program: "Dominion.c" by ONID: alzamilb

### Issue: "isGameOver" function misses cases


### Details:

When the "isGameOver" function is passed a gameState that 
contains a supply count containing one of each card except
for curse, village, and treasure_map set to zero, the function
does not return that the game is over, when there are, in fact, 
three piles of cards that are at zero. 

I believe that the issue here is an off by one (or a few) error.
The loop that checks for the number of supplyCards that are at
a count of zero goes from 0 to <25, when it should really go 
from 0 to <treasure_map+1. These are different values, and 
thus "isGameOver" does not return the correct results for this
edge case.
