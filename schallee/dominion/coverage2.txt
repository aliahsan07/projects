From GCOV:
	File 'dominion.c'
	Lines executed:19.76% of 577

This is a nearly insignificant amount of code coverage and 
really cannot claim much about its quality, but considering the 
number of tests written, it is not bad. To properly test dominion, 
each function would require numerous tests that were much more in-depth.
Aside from this, each function that was tested has decent coverage, 
although as previously stated, one test for a function is not nearly sufficient.

NOTE: 
	To run unittestresults.out, type "make myTest".
