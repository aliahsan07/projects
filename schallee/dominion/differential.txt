One of the very difficult parts of this assignment is the amount of 
information that has to be controlled to determine what is a bug or
not. Dominion does not provide an easy interface to run a full game, 
which it should, and this in turn makes testing it in this way much
more difficult. These "simple" tests that I have written, however, 
are still indicitive of the issues within dominion. Comparing the 
results between the games is difficult because of the printf differences
within each dominion implementation, but we can see differences produced
by the tester. The first difference appears on line 879 of testResults.out.
One implementation plays a card and it succeeds, while the other fails.
This appears to be an issue with the remodel card.
