BUG REPORT 3

### Program: "Dominion.c" by ONID: alzamilb

### Issue: "Smithy" card function returns incorrect value

### Details:
When playing the "smithy" card starting with:
	-Kingdom Cards: {minion, smithy, gardens, tribute, baron, adventurer, 
                        cutpurse, mine, embargo, outpost}
	-Number of Players: 3
	-Random Seed: 3
	-Player: 0
The smithy card returns a non-zero positive integer (35 in the case I tested).
It appears to draw this number of cards and then return the number of cards 
that it drew. It should only draw 3 cards, and the return value should probably
be zero, but since the documentation for this game is almost non-existent, it
is difficult to know and may depend on the implementation that one chooses.
