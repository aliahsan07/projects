Random History 

randomTestAdventurer:
	For the randomTestAdventurer.c test it covers most of the function in 	the dominion.c and the coverage has somewhat improved in percentage.

	Compared to the last coverage the coverage for this time was a bit 	smaller in percentage probably due to the fact that it only covers 	one function in the dominion.c

Development Process:
	I chose to run 100 tests on the adventurer and running it with -1 as 	choices to see what would happen.


randomTestCard:
	For the randomTestCard.c test it covered 29.39% of the dominion.c and 	which was a fair amount. I would say this random test was more 		effective because it ran 1000 tests for the remodel function.

Development Process:
	I picked 1000 tests to run for remodel and seeing if anything would 	be out of the ordinary.
