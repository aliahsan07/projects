Part 2 of Final

After reading the bug reports tested against my dominion.c I took a look at my dominion.c 
in areas of where the bugs were reported. One of the reported bugs was that smithy wasn’t 
drawing the expected amount of cards. After stepping through my dominion.c with gdb, I 
noticed that smithy was discarding the third card, therefore yielding one less card in the 
end hand. So I changed my smithy to not discard the third card it draws. Therefore making 
the smithy effect draw three cards just like it’s suppose to.
