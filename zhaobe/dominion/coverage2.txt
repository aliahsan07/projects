After my execution on the all the unit tests and card tests, my coverage for dominion.c was 51.65%. I’m not sure if that is true, but that is what I see in my unittestresults.out. 

My unit test for newGame was covered fairly well. 

Then my unit test for number of cards in the hand was also well. Didn’t seem to have much problem in this test either.

For testing players turn and if the game is over or not could’ve been a bit better in coverage.


In card testing, I see that adventurer and embargo were covered a good amount.

Then we have smithy, which gave us a bug and that will need to be fixed at some point.

Lastly, village coverage was okay and I feel like it could’ve been tested a bit more.
