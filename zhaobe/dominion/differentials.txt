What happened:
	Added testDom and runTestDom as a Makefile rule.
	Made testdominion.c which tests a game of dominion.
	Copied fahlmant dominion.c and renamed it to fahlmantdominion.c.
	Added fahlmantdominion.c to makefile as rule.
	
	Made testdominion.out as the differences file.

Take note:
	runTestDom outputs to gameResult1.out and gameResult2.out and then diffs the two .out files.



Differentials:
  I noticed that running each dominion.c with the same seed but different increments gave me consistent yet different results. When I ran both the dominion.c files with 10000 as the seed, they gave me different final scores. Which could be because each player has a different decision in purchasing a card. Then running with a 20000 seed value gave me slightly higher final scores than with the 10000 value seed.  
  The differences started at around line 37 after when player 0 has a score of 3 in one .out file while a score of 4 in the other one. As the game progressed on, each playerâ€™s scores were different from the other gameResult.out file. Then between line 124 and line 139, there were players who had a negative score. I believe there is a possible issue in the dominion implementations in that could be causing the scores to go negative midway in the game.
