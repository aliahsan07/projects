Description:
Sea hag reduces deck count of all other players when it should not be. It is true that all other players
discard the top card of their deck, but they also gain a curse to replace it meaning the deck count stays
the same and only the discard count should increase. This was found using my random tester, 2 out files, 
and the diff produced by them. In the diff, you can observe the difference after sea_hag was played
making it easy to pinpoint where the bug was.

Specifically in code:
case sea_hag:
		for (i = 0; i < state->numPlayers; i++){
			if (i != currentPlayer){
				state->discard[i][state->discardCount[i]] = state->deck[i][state->deckCount[i]--];			    
				state->deckCount[i]--;  ***********This line is not necessary delete it
				state->discardCount[i]++;
				state->deck[i][state->deckCount[i]--] = curse;//Top card now a curse
			}
		}
