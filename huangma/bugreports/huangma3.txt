Description:
The for loop in smithy is incorrect. Specifically, the i<=3 will draw 4 cards instead of 3. This was found using my random tester, 2 out
files and the diff created from them.

Specifically in the code:
int i = 0;
    for(; i <= 3; i++)
    {
        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
    }

should be changed to

int i=0;
    for(; i < 3; i++)
    {
        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
    }
