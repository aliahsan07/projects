UnitTest1
Lines executed:15.97% of 576
Nearly every line in shuffle was executed some more than others. Specifically the things in the while loop were executed
(30-35) times.

Unittest2
Lines executed:19.27% of 576
Most lines in end turn were covered, however they were only covered 1-5 times at the most.

unittest3
Lines executed:17.36% of 576
aside from the loop, most lines are only covered 1-5 times.

unittest4
Lines executed:21.70% of 576
Most lines of getwinner called but not very many times

cardtest1
Lines executed:22.57% of 576

cardtest2

village case called once

cardtest4
Lines executed:20.49% of 576
baron case called once

In general most lines were executed, but not very many times. Much of the code was also not tested so many bugs could still exist.
Since these tests only rely on correct returns, the functions could still be buggy.
