I used colliell's implementation of dominion.c as a comparason

The only difference between the two implementations of dominion starts
on line 53 of the output, where player 3 attepts to buy a smithy. 
colliell's code ouputs an extra line. It isn't a bug, just a debug 
line from the original code that colliell decided to add in. that said
it's a good line to have, so I think I'll include it too. Basically it
just means that a player tried to use card that wasn't in the deck.
