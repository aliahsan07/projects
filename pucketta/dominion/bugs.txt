BUGIXES: 

in mineEffect - 

if (state->hand[currentPlayer][oldTreasurePos] < copper || state->hand[currentPlayer][oldTreasurePos] > gold){ //gold should not be included in the check
if (state->hand[currentPlayer][oldTreasurePos] < copper || state->hand[currentPlayer][oldTreasurePos] >= gold){ //fixed, changed to >=

in remodelEffect - 

if ( (getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 1) > getCost(choice2) ){
if ( (getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 2) > getCost(choice2) ){

UNRESOLVED:

The array that stores a players' hand does not consolidate when a card
is removed from the middle. This could lead to any number of nasty 
bugs, so a fix is top priority
