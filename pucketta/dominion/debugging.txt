Bug: in scoreFor(), the third for loop has the wrong iterator. 

It reads:
for (i = 0; i < state->discardCount[player]; i++)

It should read:
for (i = 0; i < state->deckCount[player]; i++)

Reading through the output from playdom and assignment #4, I noticed a few discrepancies in 
player scores. Curious, I checked the scoreFor() function and found this rather obvious bug
It seems that whoever carelessly copy-pasted the for loops forgot to change the iterator on
the last one.

This bug was fairly subtle, since it didn't cause any outright failures. It just meant that
the player's deck would be miscounted if the iterator was the incorrect size.
