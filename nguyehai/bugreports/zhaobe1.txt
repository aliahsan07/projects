Test for adventurer doesn’t pass with my card test for testing adventurer card. The
cardEffect for Adventurer doesn’t draw until you reveal 2 treasure cards. It actually 
just draws the card Mine and discards the starting hand. So even if there was a perfectly 
normal start hand, the end hand would just retain all Mine cards. Looking at the 
dominion.c there is probably a bug in the function where adventurer’s effect is taken 
place.
