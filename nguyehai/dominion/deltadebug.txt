Downloading DD.py and MyDD.py from Zeller's website. I decided to run and modify
testdominion.c.
Upon reading the instructions on getting the delta debugging to work, I followed
the steps given in the tutorial given through the email. 
I began by identifying the test case. In this case was testdominion.c. I created
a copy of the file seen as DDdominion.c and have testdominion.c as a passing test
and DDdominion.c as a failing test case.
For identifying the deltas. I took the characters in each line and read them
and followed through the structure of the input. The passing test case is the
empty input.
For setting up the delta debugging framework, I downloaded both the MyDD module and
DD module from the tutorial and implemented part of the algorithm. 
For this particular part, I was stuck with for awhile. After restudying the basics of
delta debugging, I had to find what my delta was. For that, I had gameResults and
testdominion. This in particular aided me to test the individual lines and diff them
with eachother since it was already part of Assignment 4.
Afterwards, I've outputted both input.c and pass.c. input.c shows the diff with the
original functions and pass.c shows what was outputted from MyDD.py. It is important to
also note that when I was using MyDD.py that there was a Traceback at the end and it 
automatically exitted due to MemoryError. It may have been stuck at a for-loop but I was 
not entirely too sure about the existing error. It is documented but was not pursued any
further.
