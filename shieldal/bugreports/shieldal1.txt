Bug: Problem in cardMine function
Report by: Alec Shields (shieldal)
Bug report for olsenw

My unit test for the mine function failed in the following assertion:
"playCard(5, 0, silver, 0, s) == 0"

This shows that the mine function was reporting a failure when it should be succeeding.
Inspection of dominion.c shows that the if statement that checks that the proper card is being
traded in has a greater than symbol where it should have a less than symbol.

To reproduce this bug run cardtest2 on olsenw's dominion.c.
