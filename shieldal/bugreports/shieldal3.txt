Bug: Mine check error
Report for: galec
Report by: shieldal

Another person with a bug in the mine effect.  This person's code succeeds in trading in a copper
for a gold which is incorrect behavior.  This is because the cost checking if statement in the mine
effect has a greater than rather that a less than.

This can be reproduced by running cardtest2 on galec's dominion code.
