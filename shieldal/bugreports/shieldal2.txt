Bug: Bad loop parameters in Smithcard
Bug Report for: mendezc
Report by: shieldal

Running unittest1 on mendezc's dominion.c fails when checking that the player has drawn 3 cards.
Looking at the smithyCard function we can see that the card drawing loop executes 4 times instead
of 3 because the condition uses a less than or equal when it should be a less than.

This can be reproduced by running my cardtest1 with mendezc's dominion.c.
