I tested my dominion implementation against Curtis Minks.
I tested for the seeds 1, 2, and 3 and stored the diffs in testdominion.out.  They all showed differences which means that at least on of our implementations has a bug that the other doesn't.  By looking at what is different between the outputs I can find where a function might be doing something different in one implementation as opposed to another.  If it isn't obvious what is causing the diff I would simply need to output more information about what is going on and eventually it would be clear where I need to look to find the answer.
