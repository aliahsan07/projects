Bug Report: Council Room draws too many cards

This bug was found by my random tester for the council room card.
It was a bug that was easy to make and easy to miss, especially if
the programmer wasn't a total expert at dominion.  It simply has a 
less than or equal instead of a less than in the draw card loop.
Using a debugger, we can set a watchpoint on the current player's 
handcount and step through the code. This would show us that the 
handcount is 1 larger than it should be and that the cause is that 
we are looping 1 too many times.

There are several Agan's principles at work in the process of
finding this bug.  Understand the system is essential, we need to
know how many cards we expect to have in hand after council room is
played in order to properly check that the card is preforming as expected.
We use our random tester to 'Make it fail'.  If test the function in many
different senarios with out checks in place it is easy to see when something
goes wrong and what caused it to go wrong.  Figuring out the exact bug after
you know the effect is simple with 'Quit thinking and look'.  A quick look
at the code that draws cards for council room will show you that the loop 
condition is incorrect.  Once you have the problem area of the code, reading
it or getting someone else to read it makes it easy to find the problem.
All in all this was a rather simple bug but shows the usefulness of random
testers and careful, targeted code review.
