I ran my test dominion code with my version of dominion.c and knoppjo version.
There are about five cases where the two version have no differences when run 
with the same seed. I know I modified my dominion.c file in several places. 
I did not check to see if knoppjo changed his dominion.c file. I figure that 
because I made the changes tehre will be differences, but I am not sure as to 
why there are so many non similar games results.
