One student emailed out to the mailing list that they were going to meet in 
class to work on the code inspection. A total of six people show up in the 
class room and we broke into groups of three. I worked with knoppjo and kundec.
I reviewed Kundec dominion.c. We talked about what changes he made for 
assignment one but he did not remember any changes. I first checked his code 
for bugs I knew about from my experience of testing dominion. I was able to 
find the same bug with Baron where it would decrement Estate down to -1 if 
Baron is played with only one estate left in the game.
