One student emailed out to the mailing list that they were going to meet in 
class to work on the code inspection. A total of six people show up in the 
class room and we broke into groups of three. I worked with knoppjo and kundec.
I reviewed Kundec dominion.c. We talked about what changes he made for 
assignment one but he did not remember any changes. I first checked his code 
for bugs I knew about from my experience of testing dominion. I was able to 
find the same bug with Baron where it would decrement Estate down to -1 if 
Baron is played with only one estate left in the game. The next bug was found 
by using Kundec's Bugs.txt. He told me that he found some bugs that would be 
worth looking at like adventure. I was able to make an game state where the 
discard count was max so when adventure was played it would cause an out of 
bounds/overflow error that will segfault/game corruption.

state->discard[currentPlayer][state->discardCount[currentPlayer]++] = 
    temphand[z - 1];
    
state->discardCount[currentPlayer]++ will go out of bounds. 

The code inspection was not very formal at all. We just talked to each other 
and gave each other hints on areas where we thought there were bugs. What I 
liked about the process is that I found a bug I was completely unaware of that 
random tester was unable to find. So the point might be that working together 
for debugging is a lot more better than just one person poking at it.
