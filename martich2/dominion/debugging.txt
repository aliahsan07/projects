BUG:
sometimes when game runs the estate supplly pile will be -1. This value is not 
valid. The bug was found by examining the output of game results. debugTest 
Target in the make file is used to generate the bug logs initially, but then I 
used my own dominion.c file to verify the fix.

DEBUGING:
I saw that in the logs the previous played card before Estate when -1 was the 
Baron. I skimed the code and saw that there was several places where the Estate 
supply was decremebted. I set break points at each location in the debuger. 
Then I ran the bebugger and looked at the variable watcher to check the supply 
count for estates. I finially saw that estate went negative after calling 
gainCard and decementing. I commented out the decrement line and the bug was 
fixed.


David Agans’ Debugging Rule
1. Read the manual
    I knew from reading the Dominion rules that there were to never be less 
    than zero cards in a pile. so this clued me into the face there was a bug.
    
2. Make It Fail
    I saved the output of the game to look back to give me clues as to how to 
    approach the debuging. That is to start with the last played card.

3. Quit Thinking and Look
    I started looking at code to for where supply for estate would be 
    decremented. This lead me to the finial result.

5. Change One Thing at a Time
    I only had to change one line of code to correct the bug.
    
6. Keep an Audit Trail
    I had the game results logfiles to go back to verify the fix.

8. Get a Fresh View
    I walked through the debugging process and 
    
9. If You Didn’t Fix It, It Ain’t Fixed
    I checked the game with several know seeds that caused the bug and the bug 
    was removed.
