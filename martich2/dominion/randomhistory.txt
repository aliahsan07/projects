I started the assignment by doling the random test for the adventurer card.
I constructed random number of players, hands, and decks. In order to get 
complete coverage I had to search the player's deck to check for two, one, or 
no treasure cards. Then I will call the correct test, checkin if the hand size 
increased by one, two or none. The only two ways to break the code where to 
have a null game state or to have the size of the current players deck be 0.

I took adventure card code and used it as the base for the Village card. The 
village just draws a card and adds two actions. I check these conditions and it 
works fine. The only way to get Village to seg fault, is by giving a player or 
hand position out of bounds, or by giving a null game state. I added code for 
out of bounds player and hand position values is a condutional compilation with 
a macro. The macro is currently commented out so the program will not crash.
Beacsue Village has no branches, I was able to get complete coverage of its 
code .
