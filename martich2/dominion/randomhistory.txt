I started the assignment by doling the random test for the adventurer card.
I constructed random number of players, hands, and decks. In order to get 
complete coverage I had to search the player's deck to check for two, one, or 
no treasure cards. Then I will call the correct test, checkin if the hand size 
increased by one, two or none. I took adventure card code and used it as the 
base for the Village card.


The only two ways to break the code where to have a null game state or to have 
the size of the current players deck be 0.
