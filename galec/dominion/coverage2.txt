Unit/Card Tests
Assignment 2

RUN COMMAND:

make myTest

Unit Tests:
	1-getCost
	2-drawCard
	3-scoreFor
	4-supplyCount

Card Tests:
	1-village_rf
	2-smithy_rf
	3-feast
	4-curse


BUGS FOUND:

smithy_rf gives additional actions that it shouldn't. All other cards and unit tests worked accordingly. I switched the smithy test (cardtest2) so that the assert wouldn't stop execution of the myTest suite.

GCOV:

My test suite covered 18.21% of the code. This isn't nearly enough to get a good sense of the code and as we move forward I will need to enhance the coverage to get adecent test.
