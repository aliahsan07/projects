I chose village for my second test.

Makefile Rules:
Running both tests is accomplished with make "cooperrunAdventurer" and "make cooperrunRandomCard"

Errors:
I believe I found an error in Adventurer in that you end up with 4 extra cards in hand
after playing it, this happened after every play of the card. You should only have two new
treasure cards in hand after adventurer execution.
village appeared to run error free during my tests


Improving Coverage:
I experimented with running more versions of my test, jumping by magnitudes of 10. Going from a 
base level of 10 to 1000 led to a 3% increase in code coverage, but only for village testing. 
Running large levels of Adventurer (even only 20) would cause segmentation faults. I then started
running tests with deck sizes of 0 (to run more of the discard shuffle code) however this didn't
improve village coverage (possibly the large test size was running discard shuffle already) but I 
did see about a 3 percent increase for coverage in adventurer with this code added.
