Single test of smithy card functionality failed one of three possible asserts and stopped
execution. Possible failed asserts below:

assert x.numActions
	
assert numHandCards;

assert x.numBuys



Either the number of cards in hand, buys, or player actions are not properly being added
during execution of this card. Recommend checking the card section especially as smithy
only deals with adding cards to hand.
