A bug within my code is the Salvager card.  The bug is such that instead of giving coins 
to a player for trashing the card, it subtracts coins.

The refactored code follows:

int salvager_ref(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos, int choice1, int choice2){
  //+1 buy
    state->numBuys++;
      
    if (choice1)
    {
      //gain coins equal to trashed card
      state->coins = state->coins - getCost( handCard(choice1, state) );
      //trash card
      discardCard(choice1, currentPlayer, state, 1);
    }
      
    //discard card
    discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
    return 0;
}

The bug comes from the 8th line of this function 
state->coins = state->coins - getCost( handCard(choice1, state) );
This line causes the coins to get subtracted by the getCost, rather than being added by
the getCost. 
A unit test is used to find this bug.  This test passes in precise cards, asserts their
cost, then asserting that after a Salvager card is trashed, the players coin value is
increased by the correct value.
