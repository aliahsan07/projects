Makefile rules in Make runAdventurer and Make runRandomCard

Randomtestadventurer

To check the deck while empty was a difficult thing to do with rand(), since it rarely

RandomTestCard
I didn't have any real problems with coverage on the Gardens card.

Changed from 3 for loops to 1 for loop since it seemed excessive.
