I used Cooper Gale's dominion code with my tester.  However, his dominion.c code was very similar to mine, so the cards chosen were not bugged in Cooper's code.  
This explains why the gameResults.out file is blank.  If the tester came accross a bugged card, then the point system would be different between the players of 
his game and the players of my game (although that could be not true depending on the bug).
