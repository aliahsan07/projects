For delta debugging, I first downloaded the files on the website DD.py and MyDD.py
I wanted to debug an issue with the scoring calculations not working correctly
some of the time. It seems to often give the player a low score

Step 1: I created a simple test called deltafail which causes a failing case and another
	called deltapass in which the score is calculated correctly.

Step 2: I identified that the delta is simply the player's hand/deck/discard to be inputed
	into the score calculating function

Step 3: This is just setting up making sure the python scripts work. Everything seemed to
	go as it should.

Step 4: I wrote the debugging using the two different inputs for the test. One of it just
	used the basic starting hand and deck of a player and the other was the same but
	without the deck.

Step 5: I invoked MyDD and was able to isolate the error down to part of the code in the
	scoreFor() method. I was able to determine that the cause of the error was that
	when calculating the score out of the player's deck, it was iterating over it
	based on the size of the player's discard pile. This meant that if a player had
	nothing in their discard, then they would receive no score for their the victory
	cards in their deck.
