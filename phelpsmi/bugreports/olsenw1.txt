Bug: Adventurer card effect sometimes removes several cards from the player's hand, deck, and discard

Bug Function: CardEffect()

Bug Severity: High - Essentially game breaking because player's can accidently lose cards in the worst case. 

Bug Priority: Medium - Bug occurance is very infrequent and possibly only happens in incredibly rare edge cases.

Bug Notes: Not sure what causes this bug. I believe it has something to do with the temp hand that is created when searching for
	   the treasure but I cannot pinpoint any pattern with each of the occurances.


To run test:
	make adventurer
	randomtestadventurer

Test output will show print several lines each loop with the hand, discard, and deck of the player. To find where a failure occurs look
for where "*******************card count changed******************************" is printed. The hand/discard/deck printed above is what
the player had before the card effect took place. The hand/discard/deck is what the player ended up with after.
