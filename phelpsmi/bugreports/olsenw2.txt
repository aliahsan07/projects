Bug: After initializing the game, player two still has all their cards in the deck and nothing in their hand

Bug Function: initializeGame()

Bug Severity: Low - The rules state all players draw their initial hand as part of the set up for the game. This does not however, appear
	      to have any effect on the actual gameplay of the game.

Bug Priority: Low/Medium - Due to its low severity, this bug should not be a high priority. However, it is something players would notice if
	      if they played a game where their hands were always shown to them which means it should be given a moderate amount of priority.

Bug Notes: Unsure of how the game recovers from the fact that only player one starts out with a hand.


To run test:

Follow-up Analysis:
After doing some more research it appears that players receive their hand right at the start of their turn and not at the end of the
previous turn. This works for particular dominion because there are no attack cards but it is still against the rules of the game.
