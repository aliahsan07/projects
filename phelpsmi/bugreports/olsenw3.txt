Bug: Playing sea_hag causes players to trash multiple cards and nothing else

Bug Function: cardEffect()

Bug Severity: High - This is essentially gamebreaking as it allows players to effectively trash their opponents deck

Bug Priority: High - This is incredibly high priority to fix because the card does nothing that it is supposed to do and
	      causes 

Bug Notes: 


To run test:
	make rundominion
	Check the testdominion.out file. Player 2 should eventually buy a sea_hag and proceed to play it against player 1.

Follow-up Analysis: I have found where the issue seems to lie.

if (i != currentPlayer){
	  state->discard[i][state->discardCount[i]] = state->deck[i][state->deckCount[i]--];			    state->deckCount[i]--;
	  state->discardCount[i]++;
	  state->deck[i][state->deckCount[i]--] = curse;//Top card now a curse
	}

As you can see, it seems the writer attempted to get the end of deck by getting the count minus 1. However, the method they chose
causes that that value to also be decremented by one. As you can see, the "--" operator is applied to deckCount[i] three times in
this snipit of code when it should only happen once. Recommend changing "--" to "-1"
