For part of the assignment I decided to debug an issue with the sea_hag card.
The problem is that it would not do anything it was supposed to do and instead
it would simply trash two cards from the opponent's deck. Using a debugger I was
able to track the state of the game including the opponent player's deck/discard
along with their sizes. Doing this I found that the code was actually messing up
every time it tried to access the size of the player's deck. It wanted to get the size
of the deck minus one but in doing so was also decrementing the size by one. Because it
did this twice, the deck ended up being two cards smaller than it should have been.

I used quite a few of Agan's rules for debugging this including:

1. Understand the system: I had to know what the seahag was supposed to do in order to understand what the purpose of each part of the code was doing.
2. Make it fail: I tested the card several times in the testdominion code and it had the same bug every time
