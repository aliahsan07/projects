Assignment 1:
Refactored 5 card effects to have their own functions
Cards: adventurer, council room, mine, smithy, village

Assignment 2:

Made unit tests for: initializeGame, shuffe, buyCard, and isGameOver

initializeGame tests failed because player 2 was not given a starting hand as they should

Made card tests for: village, smithy, great_hall, and minion

I had to add a fix to minion to account for the error in the initialization
The coverage and test results can be printed using "make myTests" once all of the test files have been made
