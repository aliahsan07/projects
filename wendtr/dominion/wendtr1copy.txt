When using my card test to test the council room card, I was having an assertion
error. What was happening is my check to see if council room returned
0 was failing, and was instead returning -1. Upon investigating, I noticed that
in the cardEffect function, along with council room, I was also calling
feast and gardens. This is because there is no return statements 
after each case in the switch statement. If I were to call adventurer,
for instance, it would play adventurer, council_room, feast, and finally 
gardens.
