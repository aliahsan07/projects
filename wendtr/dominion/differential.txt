There aren't too big of differences in between this file and my file, however
some of the card operations are working differently than I thought.
Some cards are bought differently, and some cards are acting differently,
but overall, very similar. The program clearly buys things differently and, although I used the same seed for each
version of dominion, it executes different parts of the code differently.

I tested the seeds 1, 2, 3, 10, and 15. Each seed held different results for each implementation.
