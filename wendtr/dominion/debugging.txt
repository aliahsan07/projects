When redoing my unit tests, I was noticing failing test cases that didn't exist
when I submitted them. I was having different readouts than what I had
labeled for my tests. In order to see what I did wrong, I took the original
version of dominion.c and checked the differences between that, and my
alterations. In addition, I threw my coverage results for my two failing
test cases into mybugs.out, and reviewed this file. I ended up checking both
the diffs of the original and my code, as well as the .out file, and came to
the conclusion that I had modified the dominion code and added an extra drawing
phase before cards needed to be drawn. This made the players not receieve
the proper cards they were supposed to for the game.
