One of the interesting "bugs"(I guess) that I found was that after initializing the game,
player 1 was receiving 5 cards in their deck, while player 2 had 10 cards. I haven't looked into why it was happening,
but it is definitely something that may need to be addressed. 
Another bug I noticed was that the dominion code was written wrong for the remodel card. This card compares the cost
of the item in your hand + 2, and checks to see if that is less than the cost of the card you want to receive. However,
the dominon code was checking to see if it was greater than the cost of the card you wanted to receive, which would 
then mean that if you wanted to trash a province, for instance, and wanted to receive an embargo card, you wouldn't
be able to do so.
