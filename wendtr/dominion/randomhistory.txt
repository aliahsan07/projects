I initially started with the randomtests that were in the repo already.
These made for good initial starting points, but the tests were
broken (aka, they seg faulted, or had bus errors). 

In order to hit more lines for the Cutpurse tests, I made sure to check
for some copper card in another players hand. This meant that that card
would be discarded, therefore providing more coverage. It didn't get
the 1/3 results I was hoping for, but it still works at hitting those
particular lines.

For the random Adventurer tests, these were extremely broken. The problem
with these tests is that they can only run about 11 times for each loop,
otherwise they will crash and seg fault. In addition, I had to make sure to
add some type of treasure to another players hand. This is because the game
isn't initially placing treasure into a player's hand, and I am not sure 
exactly why. But the problem isn't adding the cards to the hand, it is that
if you do not add enough treasure cards to the hand, the program will 
seg fault and crash.
