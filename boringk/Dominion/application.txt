Hello Alyssa,

It is great that you guys are getting resumes through MECOP else i would forget to apply to great companies such as Planar. I am interested in this position. I highly enjoyed both my MECOP internships working in the Test and assembly area and writing programs. I will graduate at the end of this term and be done with school on June 8th, the only caveat is that I will be in Thailand from June 9th to July 11th. If this is all okay should I apply for the position on your website?

Thanks again,
         Keil Boring
