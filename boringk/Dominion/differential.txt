Test on nguyehai code
ran it with my assignment 4 and comparing the results between my .out file and seeing if any differences had occurred. 
Finding bugs was pretty easy using diff because it showed how much gold was different, hands were different and all the other informations.
Found a bug with Feast card does not decrements numActions correctly and for some reason increase the number of coins in hand by 4.
When testing all of them passed besides one of the cards and that was council room which got caught in a infinite loop.
