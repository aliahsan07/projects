Bug: Tribute gives +1 gold for treasure card

Bug Function: CardEffect()

Bug Severity: Low - Tribute other actions such as +2 cards if a victory card still works so this is minor severity. This card is just slightly worse then before with +1 gold versus the +2 gold that it should be. 

Bug Priority: Low - This occurs whenever tribute is played but is not game changing since this is only one part of tributes abilities.

Bug Notes:  Tribute is a complex card because it relies on other players cards but by printing out before and after states of card this bug should be pretty easy to see.
