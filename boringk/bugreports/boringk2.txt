Bug: Remodel does not decrement an action after being played

Bug Function: playCard() or CardEffect()

Bug Severity: low - remodel is slightly better than normal but not game changing.

Bug Priority: Medium - bug occurs whenever remodel card is being played. This will be a large percentage of games.

Bug Notes:  Bug for remodel Card. Running my test code on your dominion.c we see that numActions is staying the same at numActions=1. This should be decremented to zero after playing a card. To test this just play a game with remodel and look at the actions available after playing the card.
