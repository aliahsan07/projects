Bug: Estate Card in amidong's dominion.c

Bug Description:
	Estate Card seems to dissappear by the end of the game.

Process:
	After running my testdominion code on your dominion.c file I noticed
	that the estate card seems to completely disappear from the game by
	the end. There are many possible cause for this. The memory for the
	variables are not being allocated in memory correctly or possibly
	are being stored in volatile memory. Another cause could be the
	estate card hits 0 supply and the game drops it because it's empty.
	It is also possible a card effect gone wrong is responsilble for
	the error. A large variety of problems could contribute to this 
	problem. The game state at the beginning of the game and the game 
	state at the end of the game are displayed below. The estate card 
	is not even listed in the second list.

Bug Solution:
	In order to start figuring out where the problem is coming from,
	more in depth testing would have to be performed on the game
	state itself as the game plays out. Printing the game state every
	turn would help to see where this can go wrong. It can also be
	observed that player 0 has a score of 0 points, but when looking
	through the output file, both players have estates in their decks.
	This can also give evidence that the game is completely dropping
	the estates card from the game state so the cards aren't counting
	for anything even though they exist in the deck.
