Bug: council room card from amidong's dominion.c file

Bug Description:
	The council room card does not discard itself properly. It no
	longer shows up in the player's hand, which is good, but does
	not exist in the discard pile either. This causes an error in
	the total card count in the entire deck of the player. 

Process:
	I found this bug when I ran my card2 test on your dominion.c
	file. It was seen in the output that there was a card missing
	from the discard pile at the end of the function, and that
	card was the council room card, suggesting that it does not
	discard itself properly. The output of the test is shown below.

Bug Solution:
	Rewrite or fix the discardCard() function where you make sure the cards
	played end up in the discard pile instead of the played card pile. This
	makes the code more direct and less likely to run into errors because
	the data takes indirect routes to their destinations. After the council
	room card is played, it cannot be found in the entire deck until later
	on in the game, which adds confusion.
