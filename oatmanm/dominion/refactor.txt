Here is a list of the 5 cases from the switch statement in dominion.c that
were refactored into their own functions that were called inside of the
switch statement.

Functions:

adventurerCard - This function was written for the adventurer case in the
switch statement. It was reformatted so the indents and brackets made more
sense and were easier to look at. The parameters include drawnteasure,
state, currentPlayer, cardDrawn, temphand, and z.

councilroomCard - This function was written for the council room case in the
switch statement. It was reformatted so the indents and brackets made more
sense and were easier to look at. Most of the comments that were previously
in the case were deleted becuase they were redudant and didn't add anything
to help the reader understand the code. The parameters include state,
currentPlayer, handPos, and i.

feastCard - This function was written for the feast case in the switch 
statement. It was reformatted so the indents and brackets made more
sense and were easier to look at. I decided to leave the test statements
that were used for DEBUG inside the function because they are easy to 
understand and separate from the actual function of the code and I might
find the DEBUG statements useful later. I also deleted many of the
unnecessary brackets that existed in the if statements that were only one
line long. The parameters include state, currentPlayer, choice1, i, and x.

mineCard - This function was written for the mine case in the switch
statement. It was reformatted so the indents and brackets made more
sense and were easier to look at. Again, a lot of the unnecessary brackets
that were in one line long if statements were all deleted to free up space
and make it easier to look at. Also, almost all of the original comments
didn't help explain the function so they were deleted. Parameters include
state, currentPlayer, choice1, choice2, handPos, i, and j.

remodelCard - This function was written for the mine case in the switch
statement. It was reformatted so the indents and brackets made more
sense and were easier to look at. Almost all of the original comments
didn't help explain the function so they were deleted. Parameters include
state, currentPlayer, choice1, choice2, handPos, i, and j.
