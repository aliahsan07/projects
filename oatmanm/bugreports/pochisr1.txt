Description:
    The Mine card's cost check is wrong.

Steps to reproduce:
    1. Obtain the Mine card.
    2. Try to use the Mine card to trash a silver and gain a Village.

Expected result:
    The action should succeed.

Actual result:
    The action fails, because the condition on line 733 of dominion.c is
    incorrect. It should require the gained card to cost *at most* three coins
    more than the trashed card, but it instead requires the card to cost *at
    least* that much.
