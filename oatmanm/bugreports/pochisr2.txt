Description:
    The score returned by scoreFor() is often incorrect because it iterates
    incorrectly.

Steps to reproduce:
    1. Let N be the number of cards in your discard pile. Have at least one
       victory card in your deck whose (zero-based) index is greater than or
       equal to N.
    2. Call scoreFor() on yourself.

Expected result:
    scoreFor() should return the number of victory points in your deck,
    discard, and hand.

Actual result:
    In your deck, only victory points in the first N cards are counted, because
    the upper bound on line 445 of dominion.c uses the number of cards in your
    discard pile, not in your deck.
