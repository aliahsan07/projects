In order to check the differences between my dominion implementation and wentzj's implementation,
I used the same seed (2567) for both random seeds. 
Unfortunately, This seemed to still make these tests diverge signifcantlly. 
I mostly saw the choices in which card to play alter, so some tests would have more cards 
or more coins than the other games. 
Other than that, the games seemed to run pretty well in both implementations.
I added the diffs and the coverage to testdominion.out
