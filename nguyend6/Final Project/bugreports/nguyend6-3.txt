Bug 3: village card:

First, I ran the random test case. Then, I showed the error in the random test case. I checked all the cards that the random test case used. I made a cardtest for the sea gag card (cardtest1) and saw it functional. Hence, I based on it and made another cardtest for the village (cardtest4). I let it printed out all the information that the card supposed to do. Then, I saw that the player got 3 actions instead of 2 actions.
