I found a pretty serious bug that has been affecting my ability to test a complete game
of dominion. Whenever I have a game in which feast is present, if the choice1 card is
too expensive, it will continuously loop through printing to the screen that that card
is too expensive.

This is a problem because I had wanted to run 500 tests. Every time I run a new test
I randomize the kingdom cards, so I am bound to get a feast at some point. I also
randomize the choices for playcard, so I am bound to try to get a card from feast that
is too expensive as somepoint. This causes my tests to hang in an infinite loop, creating
a file that continues to increase in size until I manually terminate the program.

This has made it difficult to do a diff on the two files because at least one of the
files will get stuck in an infinite loop. I have tested my implementation with a single
test that does not contain feast, so I know that my test code is at least somewhat
functional.

I also found a bug with smithy that is causing the program to hang indefinately. My
current solution is to take feast and smithy out of the testing equation to see if
I can actually finish a test run.

I have now come across another bug, but this one has to do with my test implementation.
I came across a situation in which a player had zero coins, yet the curse and copper
supply piles were empty. My previous implementation would loop endlessly trying to find
something in the supply to purchase, and would find nothing.

I have finally got to a point where I am able to run 500 tests without hanging. I have taken
any cards that cause the program to hang or segfault out of the supply.
