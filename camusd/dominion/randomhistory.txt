What I did to test adventurer and Village was to run 3000 tests each
with completely random decks, hands, and discard piles. After each
test iteration, I made sure that the signifigant values were correct
as they should be after playing the card. I found that both adventurer
and smithy worked correctly, as far as how they work in a vacuum. I still
believe that they do not work in a complete game, in that when the turn
ends I believe the game state is not correct. However, I did not test that here.
