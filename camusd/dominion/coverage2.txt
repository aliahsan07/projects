I tried to run gcov on the cardtest1 - cardtest4 but because
the assert happened, at least on my machine, it would core dump.
Gcov told me that the program had never been executed. I think
this was due to the core dump.

I believe I found some bugs in cardeffect. First of all, I found that
village was never discarded after playing it and ending the turn. I also found
that adventurer was never added to playedCards. I also found that remodel never
trashes the card, it only discards it. It also adds the card to playedCards
instead of discarding it. This is important because if you had to shuffle before
your turn is over, the estate should already be in your discard, not in play.
