Bug Name: Feast infinite loop
Bug ID: 3

Description:
When feast is played with a chosen card that costs more than 5, the program enters
an infinite loop that prints "That card is too expensive!" over and over again.
This is likely caused by the while(x ==1) on line 782 of dominion.c and the else if
statement on line 791. The else if statement should return a -1 in order to avoid
the infinite loop. It should look like this:

	else if(state->coins < getCost(choice1)) {
		printf("That card is too expensive!\n");
		return -1;
	}
