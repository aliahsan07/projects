Bug Name: Played cards are not discarded
Bug ID: 2
Path: knoppjo/dominion/dominion.c
Assigned to: knoppjo
Reported by: camusd
Date reported: 6/7/2015

Description:
When a card is played, it is added to the played card area, State->playedCards[MAX_DECK].
However, when the turn ends by calling endTurn(state), the cards in play are never
discarded. This is likely caused by line 377 in dominion.c:
	
	state->playedCardCount= 0;

The playedCardCount is set to 0 without first sending the played cards to the discard.
Found by running unittest2.c.
