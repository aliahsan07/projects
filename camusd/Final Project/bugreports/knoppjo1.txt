Bug Name: Adventurer card does not enter played card area.
Bug ID: 1
Path: knoppjo/dominion/dominion.c
Assigned to: knoppjo
Reported by: camusd
Date reported: 6/7/2015

Description:
When played, the adventurer card is not added into the played card area.
State->playedCardCount is not incremented, and State->playedCards[player]
will not contain the adventurer card. The adventurer card never leaves the
players hand. This is a problem because if the player had enough actions,
he/she could replay the same adventurer card multiple times. Reproduced by
running cardtest1.c and getting an assertion error "testState->playedCardCound == 1"
failed. Most likely caused by the fact that discardCard is never called in lines
725-744 of dominion.c.
