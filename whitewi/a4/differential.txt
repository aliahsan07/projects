The two files grow more and more different as time goes on.
It starts with a small score difference that starts after Great Hall is played.
This indicates that Great Hall is not adding a victory point for the first file.
Another score difference pops up after Garden is played, so there is likely a bug with Garden as well.
A difference in the number of buys after village is played indicates a bug in Village.
At this point the differences start growing exponentially, I would fix these bugged areas and then retest.
