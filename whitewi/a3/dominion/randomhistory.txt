For randomtestadventurer I started with the code for testacard.c.
Added a MAX_TESTS for loop.
Added a seed to the arguments for repeatability.
Made the test look at the handCount to see how many cards are in the hand before and after adventurer is run.
(When adventurer is run it should increase handCount by 2)
Next I make sure that the coins increase by at least 2. (draw 2 coppers)
I found out that over half the time the coins do not increase by at least 2.

For randomtestcard I started with my randomtestadventurer code.
I changed the tests to look at number of actions and handCount
The handCount test failed of the time
	The card is drawing 2 cards instead of 1 card.
The numActions test failed of the time
	There were 0 actions left after card play
	I increased the number of actions before calling the card
	Now it does not fail as often, something about having 1 action messes it up.
