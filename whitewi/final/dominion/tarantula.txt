How I implemented tarantula:
1.  Find a failing and passing test case.

	I used ./testdominion.c 4 and testdominion.c 2

2.  Get the coverage for both of them using gcov
3.  Find the difference between the two coverages using diff

	This can be done using the command "make tarantula"

4.  I then visually inspected the output for lines that run in failing tests but not in successful ones

--------------------------------

The following lines have a high probability of being bugged:
669-765    //adventurer, council_room, feast
844-913    //village, baron, great_hall
1049-1104  //ambassador

Even a fast scan narrowed the thousand line file down to 7 functions to look at.  The bug in question is in feast and is described in debugging.txt
