After receiving an email from another student in the course inviting others to meet in the classroom to organize code inspections, six of us showed up.  Splitting into two groups of three, I worked with knoppjo and martich2 to inspect code.  I ran the code review for martich2's code and participated in the other reviews.  We walked through known issue spots, looking closely at the code to try to identify bugs.  It was very informal, with everyone giving input to the discussion.  We were able to find a few bugs.  First we identified a bug that caused baron to reduce the supply of estates by two when one was drawn.  We also found a bug in the scoreFor function that would incorrectly calculate the player's score when the player's discard and deck had different numbers of cards.
