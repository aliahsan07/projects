My unit testing showed the baron card was reducing the supply of Estates by more than the number drawn.  I isolated the test output into baronbug.out showing the effect reducing the number of Estates from 8 to 6, even though only one was drawn (Agans rule #2).  By setting a watchpoint on the estate supply count, I was able to see it change twice instead of once(Agans rule #3).  I commentted out the line and ran the test again (Agans rule #5 & 9).  I repeated the procedure for the other unit test that caused the issue (Agans rule #4), and found a similar bug in a different line.
