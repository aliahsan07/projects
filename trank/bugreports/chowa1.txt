Bug Report 1 for chowa:
Tested by Khue Tran

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Bug Found:
  The refractored Mine card function does not fail when I pass in a -1 for choice2. getCost of -1 returns another -1 so this could cause the code to continue to the end and returns 0 which tells you that the code passed some check when it really didn't. This does not affect game play much because all the internal functions are still correct and it's very unlikely that we'll be passing in a negative number in for choice2.

To Fix Bug:
  To fix this, you just need to add this to line 684:
      if (choice2 > treasure_map || choice2 < curse)
        return -1;
  This will make sure the function fails and return a -1 when choice2 is not provided in the correct range.
