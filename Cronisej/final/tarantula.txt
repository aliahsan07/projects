Joseph Cronise
Final project
Part 3

For this project I chose to implement tarantula (mostly due to the name).
I decided to use tarantula in an attempt to localize a bug reported by hubbardsp. He stated that there 
was an error wit smithy and discarding. I knew my smithy implementation was correct so I was curious 
as to where the bug came from (spoiler: I had forgotten about one of the intentional bugs I added in 
assignment 1)

The test case I used was my testcard2.c file which was designed to test smithy. What I found was 
surprising. It came back as passing, however when I looked at the terminal I noticed that there were 
more lines colored green (suspiciousness of 0) then there were lines of code in smithy. When looking 
into it I realized that village and baron were also being executed and I was quickly able to track this 
down to the lack of break statements in the switch. Meaning the cards below smithy were being 
executed up to baron (the first card with a return).

While this is perhaps not exactly the intended method of using tarantula it did allow me to find the bug 
in my code.
