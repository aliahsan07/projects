Tested: Adventurer & Steward

Bugs found: None

Testing method: Initialized a random deck and hand. set the first card in the hand to be the card I wanted to test.
 For both cards I wrote tests for every possible effect based on a random choice (in the case of steward). 
 each test displays the relevent information including the seed, test number, initial settings, etc. the tests are set to run 1000 times
