This is a bug report for a bug in the implementation of the village card effect
in Cronisej/dominion/dominion.c. The player does not gain two actions when
playing the village card. This bug was discovered and can be reproduced by doing
to following:

$ mkdir tmp
$ cp ./projects/trunk/Cronisej/dominion/* ./tmp
$ cd ./projects/trunk/hubbarsp/dominion
$ cp Makefile CS362* ll* cardtest* ../../../../tmp
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/Makefile'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest1.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest2.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest3.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest4.c'? y
$ cd ../../../../tmp
$ make cardtest3
...
$ ./cardtest3
Verify362(numActions - 1 + 2 == state.numActions) failed in file cardtest3.c, line 53
