This is a bug report for a bug in the implementation of the mine card effect in
Cronisej/dominion/dominion.c. The player is allowed to gain a treasure card
costing greater than 3 more when playing the mine card. This bug was discovered
and can be reproduced by doing to following:

$ mkdir tmp
$ cp ./projects/trunk/Cronisej/dominion/* ./tmp
$ cd ./projects/trunk/hubbarsp/dominion
$ cp Makefile CS362* ll* cardtest* ../../../../tmp
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/Makefile'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest1.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest2.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest3.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest4.c'? y
$ cd ../../../../tmp
$ make cardtest2
...
$ ./cardtest2
Verify362(coins == state.coins) failed in file cardtest2.c, line 50
