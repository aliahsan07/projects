This is a bug report for a bug in the implementation of the smithy card effect
in Cronisej/dominion/dominion.c. The 3 cards are not removed from the players
deck when the smithy card is played. This bug was discovered and can be
reproduced by doing to following:

$ mkdir tmp
$ cp ./projects/trunk/Cronisej/dominion/* ./tmp
$ cd ./projects/trunk/hubbarsp/dominion
$ cp Makefile CS362* ll* cardtest* ../../../../tmp
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/Makefile'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest1.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest2.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest3.c'? y
cp: overwrite `../../../../tmp/cardtest4.c'? y
$ cd ../../../../tmp
$ make cardtest1
...
$ ./cardtest1
Verify362(deckCount - 3 == state.deckCount[whoseTurn]) failed in file cardtest1.c, line 50
