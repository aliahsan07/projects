There are too many differences in between my gameResult.out and his gameResult.out. But there are some similar places as well. The main reason is that we have different ideas to test a complete game playing. Basically, both of us call some functions defined in dominion.c to get important information about players and their cards. In this way, console can print out entire key information about whole process, including cards drawing and cards handling. All details are generated and shown below by command "diff".
