Description: It is hard for me to find out more three bugs in a classmate. Therefore, I have chosen three classmates and write new unit test and random test for each one. In this way, I think it is easier for me to find out bugs. All results, including outputs and coverages, are written into each unitcardlevel_test_2.out and randcardlevel_test_2.out for files.
