I developed both of the random testers by taking the unit test that I wrote for
the corresponding card and deciding how to extend the unit test into a random
test.

I included debugging information in the initial versions of the random testers
to make sure that my test was correct. Since dominion already failed my initial
tests, I did not need to break the code further.

To improve coverage I increased the maximum number of tests for both random
tests. For the adventure card test, I make both the total number of cards and
the number of treasure cards in the deck and discard random to increase the
number of cases covered. For the mine card test, I made both treasure cards (the
one in the hand and the one to buy) random to increase the number cases covered.
