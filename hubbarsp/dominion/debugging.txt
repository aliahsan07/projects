TODO: Document the process of identifying and fixing a bug in your own code. You
may start with a bug report from a classmate or from your own testing. Show how
you used a debugger to understand the problem, and describe how (if) any of
Agans’ principles applied to the process. Submit this file in your dominion
directory as debugging.txt. If any files or logs are discussed in debugging.txt
make sure to also submit those!
