I wrote unit tests for the following functions: initializeGame, numHandCards,
handCard, and fullDeckCount. I also wrote unit tests for the following cards:
smithy, mine, village, adventure.

The unit test for the handCard function failed because this function will return
a card when given a card position that is greater than or equal to the number of
cards in the hand. This is clearly a bug.

The unit test for the mine card failed because the playCard function does not
fail when playing the mine card by trashing a copper and gaining a gold. A
player should not be allowed to buy a treasure card costing > 3 more and so this
is a bug.
