I wrote unit tests for the following functions: initializeGame, numHandCards,
handCard, and fullDeckCount. I also wrote unit tests for the following cards:
smithy,????, ????, ????.

The unit test for the handCard function failed because this function will return
a card when given a card position that is greater than or equal to the number of
cards in the hand. This is clearly a bug.
