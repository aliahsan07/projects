The cards that I picked to implement in their own functions are: adventure, 
tribute, treasure map, feast, and baron.

The function that implements the adventure card is named adventureEffect. I 
removed the variables cardDraw, drawtreasure, and z from cardEffect and 
added them to adventureEffect.

The function that implements the tribute card is named tributeEffect. I 
removed the variables nextPlayer and tributeRevealedCards from cardEffect 
and added them to tributeEffect.

The function that implements the feast card is named feastEffect. I removed 
the variable x from cardEffect and added it to feastEffect. I also removed 
the variable temphand from cardEffect and added it to adventureEffect and 
feastEffect.

The function that implements the treasure map card is named 
treasureMapEffect. I removed the variable index from cardEffect and added it 
to treasureMapEffect.

The function implementing the baron card is named baronEffect.
