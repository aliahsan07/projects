I ran my testdominion code on alzamilb's dominion implementation. The first
difference in the output of gameResults.txt between my implementation and
alzamilb's implementation occurs on line 229. This difference occurs when a
player attempts to play the mine card by trashing a silver card and gaining a
gold card.

In both implementations, the value returned by playCard is -1. This indicates
failure and does not change game state according to the specification in
dominion.h. But the player should be able to play this card. Moreover, the game
state does actually change.

The change in the game state for my implementation is different than the change
in game state for alzamilb's implementation. In my implementation, the player's
coin count increases by one, the played card count increases by one, the hand
count decreases by one, and the mine and silver cards are removed from the
player's hand while a gold card is added to the player's hand. In  alzamilb's
implementation, the player's coin count increases by three, the played card
count increases by one, the hand count remains the same, and the mine card is
replaced by a gold card in the player's hand.

Since this is the first time that a player attempts to play the mine card in
this game, it is very likely that the implementation of the mine card effect is
different.
