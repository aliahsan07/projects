After running each of my unit tests (including card tests) individually, gcov
reports that approximately 16, 1, 1, 2, 21, 24, 21, and 24 percent of the
dominion code is covered, respectively. After running all unit tests (including
the card tests), gcov reports that approximately 35 percent of the dominion code
is covered.

I think that it is reasonable that only a small amount of the code is covered
by the unit tests because unit tests are meant to test only one part of a
function and not intended to totally cover the code.
