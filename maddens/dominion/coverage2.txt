Unit test coverage was pretty weak. But it also makes sense that these tests don't cover a large percentage of the program because we are testing specific parts of the entire program.

I didn't see any bugs with any of the unit tests or card tests. Return values seemed right and the cards seemed to be functioning as they should be.
