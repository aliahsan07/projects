Hey I emailed you about the problem I ran into so I'm copying it here too.

I wasn't able to write to gameResults when using a classmate's dominion.c.
I was able to write to the first gameResults when using my own dominion.c but for some reason, it just hung when using my classmate's.

I committed the rest of the assignment and the makefile should account for the .out's.

Thanks.
